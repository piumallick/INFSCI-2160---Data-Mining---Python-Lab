# Background: 
A real and anonymized dataset has been used provided by UPMC. It is regarding surgical procedures between June 2017 and June 2018. The data is already divided into training and test populations. A data dictionary is also provided along with the dataset.

# Goal: 
The goal of the Python Lab is to develop an algorithm that can accurately predict patients that are at risk of a ‘long’ length of a stay post-surgery.
An abnormally long LOS or Length of Stay can be defined in numerous ways. However, for prediction purpose, a long LOS can be defined as greater than 5 days post-surgery.
Hence, turning our predictive analysis into a binary classification problem, which defines long LOS as 1 or otherwise 0.
